introduction

importance of BGP in the internet

Problems with BGP
	-prefix hijacking 
	
	-Attacks on TCP:
		eavesdropping to learn routing information (not a BGP specific attack)
		MITM (attacks against integrity
			inserting, modifying deleting messages, replay attack
		DoS attack against TCP 
			(sending RST, SYN-Flood, backhoe attack (cutting a link)
	-Attack on the routing policy using the BGP route attributes
		Exploiting as path length and MED to manipulate route selection by an AS



BGP security today: 
	target:	byzantine robustness
	Currently used: Protection of the TCP connection and defensive filtering
	
%Cryptographig techniques: 
%	Pairwise keying
%	Cryptographic hash functions
%	MACs
%	Diffie-Hellmann
%	PKI
%	Certificates	


Protection of a BGP Session between routers
	2 goals: Protecting TCP and BGP session itself
		Proposed solutions:
			MD5 integrity: Utilize TCP extension that uses a MAC based on MD5
					-> Protects integrity and prevents replay attacks

			Session and Message Protection:
				5 Proposed countermeasures:
					Adding sequence numbers
					Encryption of all BGP data between peers (shared secret)
					
					Adding UPDATE sequence numbers/timestamp
					New path attribute: PREDECESSOR: identification of last AS before destination
					digital signatures of all UPDATE fields
				Disadvantages: BGP needs to be altered
					       Based on shared secrets => hard to manage
			Hop Integrity Protocols:
				Peers can detect modification or replay attacks	
				Implemented by using sequence numbers, MACs and a PKI to refresh key

			Generalized TTL Security Mechanism
				Utilizing IP TTL to discard every packet with TTL < MAX-1. 
				
				=> Weakly defends against remote attacker, but not against malicious information coming from adjacent peers
				=> Also, useless in multihop environments
				
			IPsec
				Use IPsec to secure BGP at IP layer 
				IKE for key management, AH and ESP for packet level security
				Typically used to secure messages between peers
				Provides: authenticy, integrity, replay prevention, confidentality, DOS prevention
			


Defensive Filtering of suspicious BGP anouncments
	Goal: Filter bad and potential malicious announcmentce 
	Usually ingress and egress filtering based on route policies like:
			prefixes with special uses
			bogons/martians (advertisements of adress blocks and AS numbers with no matching allocation data)
				=> filtering using an updated list of bogons
			filter out private AS numbers
			too long AS-Pathes
			routes to small soubnets (snm > 24) 
			hard limit of announcments by a neighbour 
			filtering by customer policies
