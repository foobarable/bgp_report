introduction

importance of BGP in the internet

Problems with BGP
	-prefix hijacking 
	
	-Attacks on TCP:
		eavesdropping to learn routing information (not a BGP specific attack)
		MITM (attacks against integrity
			inserting, modifying deleting messages, replay attack
		DoS attack against TCP 
			(sending RST, SYN-Flood, backhoe attack (cutting a link)
	-Attack on the routing policy using the BGP route attributes
		Exploiting as path length and MED to manipulate route selection by an AS



BGP security today: 
	target:	byzantine robustness
	Currently used: Protection of the TCP connection and defensive filtering
	

	% Just mention those techniques in 1-2 sentences each
	%Cryptographig techniques: 
	%	Pairwise keying
	%	Cryptographic hash functions
	%	MACs
	%	Diffie-Hellmann
	%	PKI
	%	Certificates	


	Protection of a BGP Session between routers
		2 goals: Protecting TCP and BGP session itself
			Proposed solutions:
				MD5 integrity: Utilize TCP extension that uses a MAC based on MD5
						-> Protects integrity and prevents replay attacks

				Session and Message Protection:
					5 Proposed countermeasures:
						Adding sequence numbers
						Encryption of all BGP data between peers (shared secret)
						
						Adding UPDATE sequence numbers/timestamp
						New path attribute: PREDECESSOR: identification of last AS before destination
						digital signatures of all UPDATE fields
					Disadvantages: BGP needs to be altered
						       Based on shared secrets => hard to manage huge number of keypairs
				Hop Integrity Protocols:
					Peers can detect modification or replay attacks	
					Implemented by using sequence numbers, MACs and a PKI to refresh key

				Generalized TTL Security Mechanism
					Utilizing IP TTL to discard every packet with TTL < MAX-1. 
					
					=> Weakly defends against remote attacker, but not against malicious information coming from adjacent peers
					=> Also, useless in multihop environments
					
				IPsec
					Use IPsec to secure BGP at IP layer 
					IKE for key management, AH and ESP for packet level security
					Typically used to secure messages between peers
					Provides: authenticy, integrity, replay prevention, confidentality, DOS prevention
				


	Defensive Filtering of suspicious BGP anouncments
		Goal: Filter bad and potential malicious announcmentce 
		Usually ingress and egress filtering based on route policies like:
				prefixes with special uses
				bogons/martians (advertisements of adress blocks and AS numbers with no matching allocation data)
					=> filtering using an updated list of bogons
				filter out private AS numbers
				too long AS-Pathes
				routes to small soubnets (snm > 24) 
				hard limit of announcments by a neighbour 
				filtering by customer policies
				Rewrite of BGP attributes

		=> Filtering works basically well in practise but can not replace a strong security architecture



	Routing Registries
		Approach: Beeing able to have a global view on correct routes makes it easy to detect attacks
		This could be achieved by creaint a routing registry that stores the following attributes:
			prefix ownership
			Connectivity between ASes
			routing policies
			
		Problems: 
			Such a registry has to be accurate, complete and secure
			Routing information sometimes intendet not to be public available
			Full trust on registry (SPoF)
			Information may become outdated due to lazy update policies
			
	
	
	%Securing router managment
	%	Protection against physical attacks, SNMP attacks, DoS Attacks
	%       => Basic security, won't mention
			
				
	All of those described solutions are not sufficient for the protection of BGP

BGP Security Solutions

	Complete BGP Security architectures:
	
		S-BGP 
			Validates Path attributes in BGP-Update by utilizing a PKI
			Data like adress ownership, peer AS identiy, control messages, policy attributes and path vectors can be digitally signed and verified
			The ownership of a prefix is checked by an out of band mechanism called Adress attestations by the validation of a delegation chain (similar to x509 PKI)
			Route attestations happen within BGP by appending a new attribute to the BGP UPDATE mesage. Each AS in the AS path signs prior signatures.
			Problems: 
				Huge amount of data that needs to be processed and number of possible signers makes this solution computational expensive
				
				
				
		Secure Origin BGP
				
		Interdomain Route Validation
