	\section{Introduction}
	Communication in today's internet is possible by the interplay of many protocols that care for 

	\subsection{Problems with BGP}
		\subsubsection{Prefix hijacking}
%	
		\subsubsection{Attacks on TCP}
%		eavesdropping to learn routing information (not a BGP specific attack)
%		MITM (attacks against integrity
%			inserting, modifying deleting messages, replay attack
%		DoS attack against TCP 
%			(sending RST, SYN-Flood, backhoe attack (cutting a link)
		\subsubsection{Attack on the routing policy} 
		%	using the BGP route attributes
%		Exploiting as path length and MED to manipulate route selection by an AS

	\section{BGP security today}
%	target:	byzantine robustness
%	Currently used: Protection of the TCP connection and defensive filtering
%	
%%Cryptographig techniques: 
%%	Pairwise keying
%%	Cryptographic hash functions
%%	MACs
%%	Diffie-Hellmann
%%	PKI
%%	Certificates

	\subsection{Protection of a BGP Session between routers}
%	2 goals: Protecting TCP and BGP session itself
%		Proposed solutions:
%			MD5 integrity: Utilize TCP extension that uses a MAC based on MD5
%					-> Protects integrity and prevents replay attacks
%
%			Session and Message Protection:
%				5 Proposed countermeasures:
%					Adding sequence numbers
%					Encryption of all BGP data between peers (shared secret)
%					
%					Adding UPDATE sequence numbers/timestamp
%					New path attribute: PREDECESSOR: identification of last AS before destination
%					digital signatures of all UPDATE fields
%				Disadvantages: BGP needs to be altered
%					       Based on shared secrets => hard to manage
%			Hop Integrity Protocols:
%				Peers can detect modification or replay attacks	
%				Implemented by using sequence numbers, MACs and a PKI to refresh key
%
%			Generalized TTL Security Mechanism
%				Utilizing IP TTL to discard every packet with TTL < MAX-1. 
%				
%				=> Weakly defends against remote attacker, but not against malicious information coming from adjacent peers
%				=> Also, useless in multihop environments
%				
%			IPsec
%				Use IPsec to secure BGP at IP layer 
%				IKE for key management, AH and ESP for packet level security
%				Typically used to secure messages between peers
%				Provides: authenticy, integrity, replay prevention, confidentality, DOS prevention
%			
%
%
	\subsection{Defensive Filtering of suspicious BGP anouncments}
%	Goal: Filter bad and potential malicious announcmentce 
%	Usually ingress and egress filtering based on route policies like:
%			prefixes with special uses
%			bogons/martians (advertisements of adress blocks and AS numbers with no matching allocation data)
%				=> filtering using an updated list of bogons
%			filter out private AS numbers
%			too long AS-Pathes
%			routes to small soubnets (snm > 24) 
%			hard limit of announcments by a neighbour 
%			filtering by customer policies
%				

	\subsection{Routing Registries}
%		Approach: Beeing able to have a global view on correct routes makes it easy to detect attacks
%		This could be achieved by creaint a routing registry that stores the following attributes:
%			prefix ownership
%			Connectivity between ASes
%			routing policies
%			
%		Problems: 
%			Such a registry has to be accurate, complete and secure
%			Routing information sometimes intendet not to be public available
%			Full trust on registry (SPoF)
%			Information may become outdated due to lazy update policies
			
	
	
	%Securing router managment
	%	Protection against physical attacks, SNMP attacks, DoS Attacks
	%       => Basic security, won't mention
			
				
%	All of those described solutions are not sufficient for the protection of BGP

	\section{BGP Security Solutions}
	Multiple complete security architectures have been proposed to 
	\subsection{S-BGP}
%			Validates Path attributes in BGP-Update by utilizing a PKI
%			Data like adress ownership, peer AS identiy, control messages, policy attributes and path vectors can be digitally signed and verified
%			The ownership of a prefix is checked by an out of band mechanism called Adress attestations by the validation of a delegation chain (similar to x509 PKI)
%			Route attestations happen within BGP by appending a new attribute to the BGP UPDATE mesage. Each AS in the AS path signs prior signatures.
%			Problems: 
%				Huge amount of data that needs to be processed and number of possible signers makes this solution computational expensive
